Question 1
Find the output of the following code snippet: 
	int i =0, j = 0;
	int *p = &i, *q = &j;
	q = p;
	*q = 2
	cout<<i<<" "<<j;

**Answer:
	The Output will be --- 2 0

Explanation:  In the above code P and Q is storing the address of I and J.
By Q =P, Q stores the  value of P which is the address of I.
In next we assigning 2 to Q which is the address of I, now I value is changed to 2.
So the output will be --- 2 0.
